# Myco-farm

# Microchallenge I

## Concept

Mold connected to the soil through 3d printed clay structure that allows mycelium to both, grow through the mold and expand its net to eventually connect to the mycorrhizae. This allows exchange of nutrients between the mold and the natural ecosystem. Through this artifact we take resources in a more responsible way, exchanging nutrients and the new mycorrhizae network for a desired object, fruit, etc...
This proposal offers a different approach to grow mycelium than doing it in a Lab.

## Fabrication Process

-Box: For the fabrication of the box, we designed the 2D shapes of the different faces on Rhinoceros, applying the different finger edge joints on the sides and creating new squared connections on the front face to join the box with both the tubular connection and with the mold.After this, we assigned different colors following the hierarchy of the laser cut machine. red for the interior cuts and blue for the outside cuts.

then we applied the different colors
